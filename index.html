    <p>Hello, I'm Nate Bright and I'm from Berks County PA and I'm Jamacian mixed with Dutch. I can be very outgoing however
        I find a balance of chatting and alone time is a must for me. 
        when I'm out with my friends we normally like to go for long drives and listen to music,
        however when I'm at home I find spending time with my girlfriend watching movies or reading
        is where most of my time go. </p>

  <div class="j">
      <p> I'm a very big gamer. I play everything aslong
        as it has a good story. Mainly the reason
      why I enjoy playing games so much is 
    because it allows you to experience things
  that many of us will never experience in our lives. </p>
    </div>

<div class="g">
    <p>   I'm also a huge nerd. I love anything with a
      a good story,especially ones with hopeful hereos.
     I'm drawn to these heroes because they have a 
    characteristic that is very hard to find today,
   optimisim. </p>
